As previously mentioned, I'm a big music girlie. That has not changed in the few weeks since I originally scraped my music data from Spotify. In fact, I've been to two concerts since publishing that blog post and I bought tickets to two more. With that in mind, I continue to wonder why some songs speak to me more than others. Is it a single factor of acousticness? Of danceability? Is it the perfect combination of energy and instrumentalness?

In this post, I'll dive a little deeper into the statistics behind the music saved in my library. Using the Spotify API, I was able to scrape the data about each track in my liked songs, which has over 700 songs. After cleaning the data, each track has the following information:

 - popularity

- danceability
