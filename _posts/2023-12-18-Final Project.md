The NFL has become a passion of mine in recent years, and I love following players throughout their career as they play on different teams with different team dynamics. My love for college football got me thinking, "Do players in more competitive college conferences do better in the NFL?"

In this post, I'll attempt to dive into why (or why not) college conference matters for players in the NFL.

To start, here are the [college football conferences](https://247sports.com/longformarticle/college-football-power-rankings-sec-remains-toughest-conference-ahead-of-2023-season-per-phil-steele-212568334/#2194030) ranked by difficulty as of June, 2023:

#1. Southeastern Conference (SEC) -- The SEC has produced 13 of the past 17 national chamion, including each of the last four.

#2. Big Ten -- The Big Ten has produced at least one College Football Playoff participant in seven of the nine years since the four-team format began in 2014-15.

#3. Pac-12

#4. Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC)

#5. Big 12

#6. American Athletic Conference (AAC)

#7. Independents

#8. Sun Belt Conference

#9. Mountain West Conference

#10. Mid-American Conference (MAC)

With this in mind, I began to compile datasets to measure success in the NFL while connecting players with their college conference.
