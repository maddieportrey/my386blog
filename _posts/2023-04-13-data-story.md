I'm sure everyone has been on the edge of their seats since my [last post](https://maddiekkay.github.io/my386blog/2023/03/30/spotify-EDA.html), and for good reason. Who DOESN'T want to know anything and everything about my music library? 

So fine, FINE, I'll give the people what they want. Let's get into my Spotify story.

We started this journey by scraping my saved songs on Spotify (over 700 songs) and gathering the musical qualities about each song. I wondered what my songs had in common -- why I liked these specific songs. Was there a common thread? What were the songs that fell close to the averages for each category, if any? I cleaned the data and started doing an exploratory data analysis to try and figure out any consistencies among the songs.
