Hello! My name is Maddie Portrey and I'm a current Senior at Brigham Young University studying Statistics with an emphasis in data science. I plan to graduate in December of 2023, after completing an internship in the summer at Oregon Health and Science University doing Biostatistics and Bioinformatics.
