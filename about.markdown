Hello! My name is Maddie Portrey and I'm a current Senior at Brigham Young University studying Statistics with an emphasis in data science. I plan to graduate in December of 2023, after completing an internship in the summer at Oregon Health and Science University doing Biostatistics/Bioinformatics. I am extremely interested in the world of sports statistics and analysis, as well as the nonprofit sector and impact studies. I hope to one day build a career in one of these categories, but until then, enjoy my blog!
